## Description
This is a web app that helps people make informed travel decisions and focuses on reducing risk of viral infections.

Users input a starting location, a destination, and possible modes of travel. The app then performs calculations based on the datasets and compares the risks of viral infection of the various modes of travel. The user can then decide if it is safe enough to travel, and if so, what method of travel is most safe.

## Datasets
*to be determined*

## Requirements
- Node
- NPM

## Installation
To install packages and start the app, run:
```bash
npm install # install packages
node app.js # start app on 'http://localhost:3000'
```

I run my app using Google Chrome, but it should be compatible with most browsers. The app is not currently mobile friendly.

## Keywords
