3. Brief Description

    This project is going to taking input of location where citizen would like to travel, and display the virus & desease presence in that area. There will be markers circling around that area with info windows to show information about that virus & disease such as name, affeted ratio according to population, affected percentage compared to other major diseases & virus, which will be displayed as a pie chart.

 Fill in the structued description:
 * Map View:
	1. [Y] Basic Map with specific location (your map is located in a meaningful place, city of west lafayette for example)
	2. [Y] Markers for location of markets
	3. [N] Labels for markets' names
	4. [Y] InfoWindow to show detail information of a market
	5. [N] [describe] Any other cover on the map (for example, cloud cover to show the weather effect)

 * Data Visualization:
	1. [Y] [describe] Use Graph? What is the type? Affected percentage compared to other major diseases & virus, which will be displayed as a pie chart.
	2. [N] [List] Any interaction available on the graph? List them (enable click on numbers, drag on lines, change time/variables ...)
	
 * Interaction Form:
	1. [Y] [List] textfileds to ask input from user like travel destination, transportation, travel time and etc. 
             Botton to submit.
	2. [N] [List] Any operation option (filters)? List them. (search markets, search vegetables, filter based on price, sort based on convenience ...)
	3. [Y] [List] Any information input? List them. (comments, markers, user preference ...)
	4. [N] [List] Interaction with Map? List them. (filter on price will affect map markers, sort on price will affect map markers, ...)
	5. [N] [List] Interaction with data visualization? List them. (filter, sort, set variables ...)
